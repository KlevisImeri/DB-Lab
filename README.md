# How to post

In the `_post` folder you have to put you new markdown file and then add somthing like this:

```
---
layout: post
author: karam
title: LAB 1
date: 2024-10-02 17:21:46 +0100
summary: Lab 1 description
categories: [Lab 1]
keywords: lab 1, db, sql
tags:
 - db, oracle, sql
---

# Your markdown text here
```

You can have to edit the author, title, date and so on by yourself.

Put the images in the assests and link them as normal in markdown.
Refer to the about as an example.

You should also rename the posts to 
`yyyy-mm-dd-textyouwant.md`
