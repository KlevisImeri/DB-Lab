## Questions Asked by Students

The questions will come here.

## Designing an ER diagram
*Entity*: a thing (physical or logical) that exists and is distinguishable from others (by distinctive features, properties = attributes)
A group consisting of all "similar" entities forms an *entity set.*
*Relationship Sets:* Diamonds represent the relationship sets defined among two or more entity sets.
Each entity set has a set of *attribute types* associated with it, and must have *a distinguishable key.*
Rectangles represent Entity Sets, and Circles represent attributes. The underlined attribute represents the key of that entity set.
*Cardinalities* of the relationship set: One to One, One to Many, Many to Many

## Mapping from ER model to Relational Model
Since the ER model is a "half-model", we will eventually need to convert it to a Relational Model.

An entity set would correspond to a *relation (table).*
Each attribute in the entity set would correspond to an *attribute (column).*
Each entity would correspond to a *record (row).*
The keys of the entity sets are the unique identifiers, so they correspond to *Primary Keys* of the tables.

Many-To-Many relationship sets become a relation. $A(a,c)$ and $B(b,d)$, then $C(a (FK),b (FK))$    
Many-To-One relationship sets: the primary key of the "restricted" entity set becomes a foreign key for the "non-restricted" one.
One-To-One relationship sets: the primary key of the "restricted" entity set becomes a foreign key AND unique for the "non-restricted" one.
## SQL DDL, DML, etc.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (...);

DROP TABLE <table_name>;

INSERT INTO <table_name> [(<column_name1> [<column_name2>,
...])]
VALUES (<value1> [, <value2> , ...]);

DELETE FROM <table_name>
[WHERE <condition>]

UPDATE <table_name>
SET <column_name1> = <value1> [,<column_name2> = <value2>,
...]
[WHERE <condition>];
```

## Other Comments
Understand constraints!
Explain every step of your thought process. DO NOT just attach an ER diagram without explanation!
