## Why this subject is essential, coming from a fellow student:

### Databases are important for other university courses
- Software Techniques (4th semester)  
- Data-Driven Systems (5th semester, Software Engineering specialization)  
- Data-Driven Software Development Lab (6th semester, Software Engineering specialization)
- Mobile and Web Based Software (5th semester, Professional Subject)

### When getting a job, it's either a requirement or a strong plus

### Specializing in the future

- As a **backend developer**, you'll need to use databases
- As a **full-stack developer**, ...
- As a **mobile app developer**, you'll need to manage user data, preferences, and settings (SQLite, Firebase, MongoDB)  
- As an **AI/ML engineer**, you need to understand data, how to manage it and how its stored (all these models, including ChatGPT, are trained on data)  
- As a **cloud engineer**, you're going to use databases (e.g. AWS DMS, AWS RDS, AWS DynamoDB)
- **Cybersecurity**: How can you secure sensitive data and protect databases if you don't understand how they work?
- **Data Science, Data Engineer, Data Analyst**: Do I even need to explain?  
And so on...  

## About the Lab Requirements
![image](assets/img/About/lab.png)

You need to prepare before the labs, entry tests are taken seriously. You can prepare for entry tests using the course materials on https://www.db.bme.hu/databases/

Lab 1, Oracle has a course material PDF.  
Labs 2, 3, and 4 corresponding to SQL1, SQL2, and SQL3 have the same course material PDF.

- For the first SQL lab, you should be prepared from table definition, data manipulation statements and from the ER modeling and ER->relational mapping chapters of the Databases course.  
- For the second SQL lab, you should be prepared from SQL queries.  
- For the third SQL lab, you should be prepared from the entire SQL guide.

Passing an entry test is only one of the requirements, **it does not mean that you passed the lab.**

To pass the lab, the other requirement is to submit a detailed, clearly formatted lab report answering questions. **This is the most important part.**

You have to name all your submitted files properly. For example, the PDF in the first lab should be NEPTUN-1-c16.pdf, where you should substitute NEPTUN with your actual NEPTUN code.  

**Explanation > Correct Answer:**  
The correct answer alone will not give you any points.  
Your explanation as to how you got your answer (even if it was a wrong answer) can give you some points.  
The best thing to do is to give a correct answer and explain it clearly, perhaps using screenshots.  

**The evaluators of the lab reports are a separate entity!**

- Find the lab report template here: https://www.db.bme.hu/databases/  
- Submit it on the lab portal, here: https://fecske.db.bme.hu/

## A few remarks

- As your lab instructors, it is **NOT** our job to give you answers to the lab questions. Our duty is to make you think by giving you hints and nudging you in the right direction.  
- Being physically in the lab is not enough. You'll need to make sure that you are present, participating, and putting effort into solving the questions.
